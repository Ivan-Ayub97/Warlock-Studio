%   SECTION 5: BEST PRACTICES & OPTIMIZATION
% =======================================================================================
\setsectioncolor{OptimizeColor}
\section{Performance Optimization and Best Practices}

\subsection{\faSlidersH\ Critical Performance Parameters}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Input Resolution \%:} This is the most influential parameter on processing speed. A value between \textbf{50\% and 75\%} implements an initial downsampling before upscaling, drastically reducing the computational load with minimal impact on the final perceptual quality.
    \item \textbf{GPU VRAM Limiter (GB):} Defines the video memory budget allocated to the process. It is crucial for the dynamic calculation of processing tile sizes and for preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Set it to a value equal to or slightly lower than your GPU's total VRAM.
    \item \textbf{AI Multithreading:} (Video only) Allows for the parallel processing of multiple frames. It significantly increases performance on systems with multi-core CPUs, but at the cost of higher VRAM and CPU consumption. It is recommended to start with 2 threads and increase gradually.
    \item \textbf{AI Blending:} Mitigates visual artifacts that can arise when using a low "Input Resolution" percentage. It performs an alpha blend between the original upscaled image and the AI-processed image for a more natural result.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\faTrophy\ Tips for Maximum Quality Results}
\begin{description}[leftmargin=*, style=nextline, itemsep=0.8em]
    \item[Maximizing Visual Fidelity] To achieve the highest possible quality, use the \texttt{BSRGANx4} or \texttt{RealESRGANx4} models with an \textbf{Input Resolution} of \textbf{100\%}. This process is computationally intensive but produces the most detailed results with the least amount of information loss.
    \item[Workflow for Video Restoration] An effective pipeline for restoring old archive footage consists of a first pass with a denoising model (e.g., \texttt{IRCNN_Mx1}) to clean the signal, followed by a second pass with an upscaling model (e.g., \texttt{RealESR_Gx4}) on the already processed video.
    \item[Impact of SSD Storage] A Solid State Drive (SSD) drastically accelerates video processing, as the extraction, writing, and subsequent reassembly of thousands of individual frames constitute the main I/O bottleneck of the system.
    \item[Frame Persistence for Experimentation] If you plan to experiment with different video codecs or bitrates, enable the \textbf{"Keep frames"} option. This will preserve the processed frames on disk, allowing you to re-encode the video without needing to repeat the costly AI inference process.

% =======================================================================================
\setsectioncolor{TroubleColor}
\section{Diagnostics and Troubleshooting}
\begin{warnbox}{Primary Cause of Errors}
The \textbf{\#1 cause} of processing failures is \textbf{non-standard characters} in file paths and filenames. Avoid using: \texttt{', ", @, \#, \$, \%, \&, *, [, ], ?, etc.}.
\end{warnbox}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=*, style=nextline, itemsep=0.8em]
    \item[\faBan\ Error: "FFmpeg encoding failed: Invalid argument"]
        \textbf{Diagnosis:} FFmpeg's multiplexer has received an invalid argument, commonly a malformed file path.
        \textbf{Solution:} Rename the source file and/or its containing directory, removing any special characters or diacritics.

    \item[\faRocket\ Error: "Failed to load model" or Execution Provider Failure]
        \textbf{Diagnosis:} Failure in the initialization of the selected hardware backend (CUDA or DirectML).
        \textbf{Solution:} The system is designed to automatically fall back to a functional provider in the hierarchy (CUDA -> DirectML -> CPU). To resolve the root cause:
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep, leftmargin=*]
            \item \textbf{For CUDA errors:} Verify the installation of the latest NVIDIA drivers (Game Ready or Studio).
            \item \textbf{For DirectML errors:} Ensure that the Windows operating system is fully updated and that you have the latest drivers for your GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel).
        \end{enumerate}

    \item[\faMemory\ Error: "out of memory" (OOM) or Unexpected Crash]
        \textbf{Diagnosis:} The GPU's VRAM has been exhausted.
        \textbf{Solution:}
        \begin{enumerate}[nosep, leftmargin=*]
            \item Lower the \textbf{VRAM Limiter} to a value equal to or less than your GPU's physical VRAM.
            \item Decrease the \textbf{Input Resolution \%} to 75\% or less.
            \item For videos, reduce the number of \textbf{AI Multithreading} threads.
            \item The application will attempt an automatic recovery from this error by reducing the processing tile size and retrying the operation.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item[\faTachometerAlt\ Error: "cannot convert float NaN to integer"]
        \textbf{Diagnosis:} GPU driver timeout (TDR - Timeout Detection and Recovery), often caused by hardware overload or overheating.
        \textbf{Solution:} Restart the process \textbf{without deleting the generated frames folder}. The application will detect the existing frames and resume the task from the point of failure.
\end{description}

% =======================================================================================
%   SECTION 7: ADVANCED TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
% =======================================================================================
\setsectioncolor{ArchColor}
\section{Software Architecture Analysis}

\subsection{\faCogs\ Inference Engine and Hardware Abstraction}
Warlock-Studio is built upon a multi-layered inference engine powered by \textbf{ONNX Runtime}. This system abstracts the underlying hardware and prioritizes Execution Providers to maximize performance:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{CUDA (\texttt{CUDAExecutionProvider}):} The highest performance option, leveraging the parallel computing architecture of NVIDIA GPUs.
    \item \textbf{DirectML (\texttt{DmlExecutionProvider}):} If CUDA is not available, the system falls back to DirectML. This Microsoft API translates neural network operations into native \textbf{DirectX 12} calls, ensuring broad hardware compatibility (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).
    \item \textbf{CPU (\texttt{CPUExecutionProvider}):} This is the last resort provider. If no GPU acceleration is viable, the application runs the model on the CPU, guaranteeing universal functionality at the cost of significantly lower performance.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\faThLarge\ Dynamic Tiling and Memory Management}
To process high-resolution images and videos that would exceed available VRAM, the application implements a "tiling" system. Each frame is subdivided into fragments (tiles) of a size dynamically calculated based on the user-configured \textbf{VRAM Limiter}. If an out-of-memory (OOM) error occurs, the system can autonomously reduce the tile size and retry the operation, providing a robust recovery mechanism.

\subsection{\faSyncAlt\ Resume and Checkpointing Functionality}
If a video process is interrupted (either by the user or by an error), the frames already processed and written to disk are preserved. Upon restarting the same task, the \inlinecode{check\_video\_upscaling\_resume} function detects these partial files and resumes the processing pipeline from the last pending frame, saving a significant amount of computation time.

\subsection{\faBolt\ Asynchronous Frame Writing}
During video upscaling, the frames processed by the GPU are placed in a queue managed by a separate writer thread. This decouples the GPU processing (very fast) from the disk I/O operations (slower), allowing the GPU to begin processing the next batch of frames without waiting for the previous batch to be physically written to disk.

    \item[Tiling] A technique of dividing a large image into smaller "tiles" to be processed individually. It is an essential mechanism for handling resolutions that exceed available VRAM.
    \item[Codec] (Coder-Decoder) A software or hardware algorithm/device that compresses and decompresses digital video data. Examples of software codecs are x264 (H.264) and x265 (HEVC). Hardware codecs (NVENC, AMF, QSV) use dedicated encoders on the GPU to accelerate this process.
